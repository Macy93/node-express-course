1.  Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
        In an Express application, middleware gets executed after the server receives
        the request and before the controller actions send the response. It has 
        access to the request, response, and next objects. An Express-based application
        is a series of middleware function calls.
2.  What does CRUD stand for?
        CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
3.  You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    A. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
        To access the information in a .env file you would first need to
        download the `dotenv`package. Once that is set up, you can access the 
        .env information from anywhere in your code using the `process.env`
        method. Also, you need the require("dotenv").config() to load it. 
    B. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored 
       in your Github repository?
        You protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored or pushed
        to Github by putting the .env file into the .gitignore file.
